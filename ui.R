Students from certain majors reported higher average alcohol consumption compared to their peers in other disciplines. This trend could be due to the cultural and social factors that exist within different fields of study."),

Students with higher average GPAs tended to consume fewer alcoholic drinks per week. This inverse correlation suggests that excessive alcohol consumption may negatively impact students' academic performance, possibly due to reduced study time and increased class absences resulting from hangovers or fatigue."),

These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions and support systems to address alcohol-related issues within the student population. Universities and policymakers can use these insights to develop programs that promote healthier lifestyles and academic success. By understanding the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption, stakeholders can create more effective strategies to mitigate its negative effects and support students in achieving their academic and personal goals."),
