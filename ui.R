High consumption in fields like Engineering and AgriSciences suggests a need for stress management and social responsibility initiatives. Conversely, understanding the low consumption in Law, Medicine, and Sciences can provide insights into how academic pressures and professional expectations shape student behaviors. This analysis is crucial for university administrators and student services to develop tailored interventions, promoting a healthier campus environment.</p>
                      <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>How to Use the Graph:</strong> The bar chart below allows you to explore the average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week by students, categorized by their major and school year. Use the checkboxes on the left to select specific majors and school years you are interested in. The bars will update dynamically to reflect your selections, providing a clear visual comparison across different groups. This interactive feature helps you focus on particular demographics and understand their drinking patterns more precisely.</p>')

This trend could be due to the cultural and social factors that exist within different fields of study."),

Students with higher average GPAs tended to consume fewer alcoholic drinks per week. This inverse correlation suggests that excessive alcohol consumption may negatively impact students' academic performance, possibly due to reduced study time and increased class absences resulting from hangovers or fatigue."),

These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions and support systems to address alcohol-related issues within the student population. Universities and policymakers can use these insights to develop programs that promote healthier lifestyles and academic success. By understanding the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption, stakeholders can create more effective strategies to mitigate its negative effects and support students in achieving their academic and personal goals."),
