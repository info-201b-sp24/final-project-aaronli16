This project that we did aimed to analyze the patterns and trends of alcohol consumption by students based on many factors for example their major, academic performance, and parental influence. The data for this study was sourced from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle, titled 'Student Alcohol Consumption,' which contains responses from students regarding their drinking habits, academic performance, and various personal and demographic factors which they got through surveys."),

Firstly, we found a significant correlation and connection between a student's major and their drinking habits. Students from certain majors reported higher average alcohol consumption compared to their peers and students in other disciplines. This trend could be because of various cultural and social factors which exist within different fields of study."),
             p("Secondly, our analysis revealed a relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance. Students with higher average GPAs tended to consume fewer alcoholic drinks per week. This inverse correlation suggests that consuming too much alcohol may negatively impact academic performance of the students, possibly due to reasons such as reduced study time and increased class absences resulting from hangovers or fatigue."),
             p("Thirdly, the influence of parents on students' drinking behavior was notable. Students whose parents disapproved of alcohol consumption generally reported lower levels of drinking. This finding underscores the role of parental attitudes and communication in shaping students' behaviors and choices."),
             p("The data provides valuable insights into the complex connections and correlations between alcohol consumption, academic performance, and parental influence among students. These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions and support systems to address alcohol-related issues within the student population. Universities and policymakers can use these insights to develop programs that promote healthier lifestyles and academic success. By understanding the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption, stakeholders can create more effective strategies to mitigate its negative effects and support students in achieving their academic and personal goals."),
